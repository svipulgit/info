Better - >W (32,768), >LP (100), <AD (200 - iBgp), <MED (0)

W:
The weight is assigned locally to the router.
Routes with a higher weight value have preference when multiple routes to the same destination exist.
A weight can be a number from 0 to 65,535. Paths that the router originates have a weight of 32,768 by default, and other paths have a weight of 0.

LP: (Metric2)
Local preference is an indication to the AS about which path has preference to exit the AS in order to reach a certain network. A path with a higher local preference is preferred more. The default value for local preference is 100.
Unlike the weight attribute, which is only relevant to the local router, local preference is an attribute that routers exchange in the same AS.
You set local preference with the issue of the bgp default local-preference

AD (bnp->bgp_preference):
The administrative is used to choose the best routing among many routing.
 The admin distance never comes into play when two BGP paths are compared. The BGP best path selection process will determine the best path and then the admin distance (20 or 200) will be used to select the route to install in the RIB
CliRibd: neighbor <> distance N (per neighbor)
EOS Cli: distance bgp N  (iBgp / eBgp)

MED: (Metric)
The metric attribute also has the name MULTI_EXIT_DISCRIMINATOR, MED (BGP4), or INTER_AS (BGP3).
A lower metric value is preferred more. The metric default value is 0.
Unlike local preference, metric is exchanged between ASs
